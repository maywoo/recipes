Pork Shoulder in the Slow Cooker 

Serves 4-6


1/4 cup olive oil

2 tablespoons coarse salt

2 teaspoons coarse ground black pepper

1 clove garlic

1 sprig of fresh rosemary (or one teaspoon dried rosemary leaves)

1 (3-4 pound) pork shoulder roast (also called picnic or butt roast)

Combine the olive oil, salt, black pepper and garlic in a food process and pur√©e.  Rub the mixture over the surface of the pork roast, then set it fat-side-up in a slow cooker.  Set the rosemary on top of the roast, cover, and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, until fork-tender.  Meat will lift easily off the bone when ready to carve.  Pour juices on top to serve.
